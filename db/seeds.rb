Always coming by for refills and quickly clearing the table when I just about finish my plate.\r\n\r\nWe had ordered the 12-piece Nigiri Omakase ($68 per person) and I must say it's an experience. It will take time to get through Omakase (over an hour or so), but I think it's pleasant since you try little by little. By doing this, I don't feel bloated or too full when done and you get to interact in good conversation in between the courses. Definitely a must try and the vibe/service of Tsubasa made our 2nd anniversary that much more intimate and special.", rating: 4},

  {user_id: 3, business_id: 1, content: "One of the most accommodating restaurants I have EVER dined at. If I could describe the feeling of being cradled and rocked to sleep as an adult, it would be my experience at Kusakabe.\r\n\r\nWe got stuck in awful traffic coming up the peninsula and ended up getting to the restaurant 45 minutes after our reservation time. The most stressful part of the trip was not being able to get a hold of anyone at the restaurant because their phones shut down after 4pm. I left a message anyways to let them know my situation and they ended up calling me back to confirm. When we arrived, they seated us immediately and didn't give us too much crap for being so late. :-)", rating: 5},
  {user_id: 3, business_id: 2, content: "Setup/Atmosphere/Authenticity: Two fixed menu's for $150 and $200/per (see menu pictures).  Sake pairing available for additional cost or separate drink selection available for 8oz or bottle.  We went w/ the $200 option, no sake pairing, and ordered our own selection of sake off the menu.  Each dish is brought out individually at your own pace.  Depending on how fast you eat this can lead to a lengthy meal. Reservations VERY HIGHLY recommended.  The entire space can probably seat approx. 20 - 25 people total at a time.   There is a sushi bar that fits majority of the guests w/ 2 or 3 small tables in the front that seat 2 people each.  There are 3 chefs at a time and it is meant to be entertainment/dining.  If sitting at the bar it is recommended to engage w/ the chefs.  It seems to be reservations based, and fixed in waves to keep the menu along the same pace so the chefs aren't all over the place.  No jacket required, but would not come in jeans and a t-shirt.  Everyone fits the theme of a Japanese restaurant, sushi chefs (self explanatory and waitresses in kimonos)\r\n\r\nService: Waitresses are very attentive.  As soon as you finish one dish they collect the dish and wait till the table is ready for the next course.  They also explain what each dish is when brought out which was very helpful as I wouldn't be able to pronounce or even know what some of the items were.  I also asked for a breakdown of the sashimi section and they hand-wrote each dish (w/ the English definition) on a fancy paper!  They had the chefs even sign it!  They also provided a card w/ the chef's signatures (and little drawings) for someone's graduation.  Very thoughtful and cool from the chefs!  The hostess also came by to talk to us and she was extremely friendly and offered several recommendations.  You could ask them anything about the food and they were more than happy to answer and be of service!\r\n\r\nQuality of Food:  Wow, just wow!  Most of the items I would probably not order at any other restaurant because I usually don't eat or just not a favorite.  Decided to go out of my comfort zone and I was very happy I did.  Everything was absolutely delicious!  A perfect example was the Uni.  Not a fan of uni - mainly for the texture but when I tried it here it was so smooth!  Same w/ the sashimi - very fresh fish and as you would say \"not fishy\" is actually good!  They serve the best parts of the fish and each dish was very flavorable.  My only issue is the amount of wasabi they put on the sashimi.  Since that part of the experience is meant to be enjoyed w/ your hands, they actually put a little bit of wasabi and soy sauce in between the fish and rice.  This is cool - never experienced it that way but I am also very sensitive to wasabi.  So when I stuck the pieces in my mouth unknowingly I was in for a little shock.  It really wasn't much but I use very little wasabi on my sushi so I would've liked less and/or more spread out instead of it more as a glue for the fish and rice.  They offered us a complimentary sake in the beginning and it was fruity which I really enjoyed (picture w/ the bottle and metal cups)!  The one we ordered w/ our meal was recommended by the host.  It was very good as well!  Not as fruity, more dry, but very smooth.  It was easy to drink.\r\n\r\nOverall:  I definitely enjoyed the overall experience.  Given that I'm usually pretty easy to please I don't go out to nice restaurants.  I was definitely glad I went a little out of my comfort zone both w/ the price and the food.  I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a good, authentic, Japanese sushi bar.  I would not recommend coming here though if you're just looking for rolls.  This place is mainly a highlight to more authentic sashimi dishes.  As mentioned I also recommend making reservations and engaging w/ the staff (both the chefs and the waitress).  Realistically I probably won't be going back on my own any time too soon for a casual dinner or quick bite.  After the full meal we were there for almost 2 1/2 hrs and it didnt even feel that long till after I looked back at the time.  However if someone wanted to go for a special occasion I would not hesitate!", rating: 5},

My friends and I came to celebrate a birthday at Omakase, and we made reservations a few weeks in advance for their first seating at 5:30pm. The space is quite small, with about 15 counter seats and two small tables. They started off with a complimentary pour of a nice sake, which was very nice. Although all the ingredients seemed fresh, we all left feeling underwhelmed with the meal, especially for the price. The combination of ingredients for some of the dishes was a bit strange, such as the pairing of slimy mountain yam with the ankimo for our appetizer. Also, the dishes were on the bland side, and/or were not elevated at all.\r\n", rating: 3},
